    /**
     * Imagettftextblur is a drop in replacement for imagettftext with added
     * parameters to add blur, glow and shadow effects to your PHP GD images.
     *
     * @param resource $image          <p>An image resource, returned by one of the
     *    image creation functions, such as imagecreatetruecolor().</p>
     * @param float    $size           <p>The font size. Depending on your version
     *    of GD, this should be specified as the pixel size (GD1) or point size
     *    (GD2).</p>
     * @param float    $angle          <p>The angle in degrees, with 0 degrees being
     *    left-to-right reading text. Higher values represent a counter-clockwise
     *    rotation. For example, a value of 90 would result in bottom-to-top reading
     *    text.</p>
     * @param int      $x              <p>The coordinates given by x and y will
     *    define the basepoint of the first character (roughly the lower-left corner
     *    of the character). This is different from the imagestring(), where x and y
     *    define the upper-left corner of the first character. For example, "top
     *    left" is 0, 0.</p>
     * @param int      $y              <p>The y-ordinate. This sets the position of
     *    the fonts baseline, not the very bottom of the character.</p>
     * @param int      $color          <p>The color index. Using the negative of a
     *    color index has the effect of turning off antialiasing. See
     *    imagecolorallocate().</p>
     * @param string   $fontfile       <p>The path to the TrueType font you wish to
     *    use.</p><p>Depending on which version of the GD library PHP is using, when
     *    fontfile does not begin with a leading / then .ttf will be appended to the
     *    filename and the library will attempt to search for that filename along a
     *    library-defined font path.</p><p>When using versions of the GD library
     *    lower than 2.0.18, a space character, rather than a semicolon, was used as
     *    the 'path separator' for different font files. Unintentional use of this
     *    feature will result in the warning message: Warning: Could not find/open
     *    font. For these affected versions, the only solution is moving the font to
     *    a path which does not contain spaces.</p>
     * @param string   $text           <p>The text string in UTF-8 encoding.</p>
     *    <p>May include decimal numeric character references (of the form:
     *    &amp;#8364;) to access characters in a font beyond position 127. The
     *    hexadecimal format (like &amp;#xA9;) is supported.Strings in UTF-8
     *    encoding can be passed directly.</p><p>Named entities, such as &amp;copy;,
     *    are not supported. Consider using html_entity_decode to decode these
     *    named entities into UTF-8 strings.</p><p>If a character is used in the
     *    string which is not supported by the font, a hollow rectangle will
     *    replace the character.</p>
     * @param int      $blur_intensity <p>The number of times you would like to
     *    apply your filter to your text (default is zero)</p>
     * @param int      $blur_filter    <p>The filter you would like applied to your
     *    text (default is IMG_FILTER_GAUSSIAN_BLUR)</p>
     *
     * @return mixed Returns an array with 8 elements representing four points
     * making the bounding box of the text. The order of the points is lower left,
     * lower right, upper right, upper left. The points are relative to the text
     * regardless of the angle, so "upper left" means in the top left-hand corner
     * when you see the text horizontally. Returns FALSE on error.
